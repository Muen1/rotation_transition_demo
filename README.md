# RotationTransition Demo

A simple Flutter app demonstrating the use of the **RotationTransition** widget to animate a refresh icon.

## Description

This demo shows how to use `RotationTransition` to create a smooth spinning effect for a refresh icon.  
When the "Refresh Data" button is pressed, the icon rotates continuously to indicate a loading process, and a `SnackBar` confirms when the refresh completes.
